        <br>
        <p style="border:1px solid green;">My name is Kenneth Weed, I am from <i>Westerly, RI </i>and grew up in Griswold, CT.
            <br> I am a United States Coast Guard Veteran, and have had many different jobs since I
            <br> left the military. Currently I am enrolled at school at NEIT for <b>Cybersecurity</b>.
            <br> I am very excited to start my career in Cybersecurity, so I no longer have to work in <u>restaurants</u>.
