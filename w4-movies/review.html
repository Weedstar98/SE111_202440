            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Review of <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em></h2>

            <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Kenneth Weed</b>, <i>8,10,2024</i></p>

            <p><em>The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</em> is inarguably one of the greatest movies to ever grace
            the big screen. Okay, that might be a little biased, but it really does stand the test of time, and will be covered
            by film students far into the future. Why? Well there is a multitude of reasons. Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema
            undertook one of the greatest risks in movie history by filming three movies (Fellowship, Two Towers, and Return of the King)
            simultaneously. Lord of the Ring for the longest time had long been considered "unfilmable" due the sheer amount of material
            in the books by famed author J.R.R. Tolkien. This changed in 2001 however with the arrival of <em>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.</em> 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Let's break down why this movie is one of the best ever filmed. First, is the sheer amount of practical effects present in the movie.
                Hundreds of hours by the special effects team were put into painstaking details for each characters (main and background alike) costumes and 
                weapons being used. All of the armor you see on screen is made by hand. While there were undoubtedly scenes were CGI was used, this insistence on practical 
                effects keeps the movie from aging rapidly as the authenticity of the character's outfits makes the world feel real and more lived in. Secondly, the performances 
                by the main characters are all true to Tolkien's writing (except Gimli, but his usage as a comedic relief works well to contrast with the seriousness of Legolas,
                making their friendship far more interesting for movie-goers). When you think of Frodo, you think of Elijah Wood. When you think of Gandalf, you think of Ian Mckellen.
                The performances by these actors perfectly embody who they are playing, with each member of the Fellowship having distinct personalities and goals.
                Third, the score is top-notch. Howard Shore's work here is on-par with the greatest film composer of all time: John Williams, particularly the main motif piece of the movies 
                "Concerning Hobbits". Lastly, the story structure here works great as a standalone movie. While Two Towers and Return of the King are both excellent, <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>
                helps to establish the world, introduce us to the lore, establish characters and their personalities, and SHOWS us the world instead of just telling us about it (a common problem in modern movies).</p>
                <br>
                <p>In conclusion, <em>The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</em> has all the hallmarks of a groundbreaking film. The love and care put into it by everyone involved
                is present throughout. This adaptation will stand the test of time (there is a reason they will never try to reboot it), and will be enjoyed by Tolkien fans and movie-lovers alike for years to come.</p>

                <h4>Some <em>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</em> trivia and fun facts:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>When Gandalf is inside of Bag End with Bilbo he hits his head on the wooden beam. This was not in the script, however Peter Jackson felt that the imrpov to act through the mistake by Ian McKellen was so impressive he kept the shot in the film.</li>
                    <li>Sean Bean was afraid of flying, opting to only do so when absolutely necessary. When filming the Pass of Caradhras scene in the snowy mountains, Bean would walk up the mountain for two hours in his Boromir costume (often being passed by other cast members in helicopters flying above him).  </li>
                    <li>John Rhys-Davies plays Gimli, a dwarf, however he is actually the tallest cast member in the entire Fellowship.</li>
